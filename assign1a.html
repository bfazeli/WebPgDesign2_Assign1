		<h1>About me:</h1>
		<h2 class="myClass1">I am a nerd who lives a double life.</h2>

		<p style= "text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify">I am an aspiring developer that is 25 years old, from Norwalk, Ca. My long-term educational goals are having fun in CS and making a living developing applications. The reason why I am pursuing Software engineering is because of my friend. I wanted to find a new passion in life and he was the one that introduced me to programming. Since then I have loved developing applications and enjoy the challenge that comes along developing software.</p>
		<p style= "text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px">Furthermore, I am a self-motivated, and self-drivin individual that works well both individually and alongside a team of developers. I enjoy solving quick problems by documenting my solution in order to communicate with clients as to what was wrong and what was fixed. I'll be publishing my first Adnroid application to the google play store in the next two months.</p>
